# Minify (more) for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)

*Originally created by Alfred Xing. This is just a small change to attempt a deeper minification, using "SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS" instead of simply removing the whitespaces. Minifies JavaScript and CSS files in Brackets and saves to `{filename}.min.{ext}` using Google's Closure Compiler (for JavaScript) and YUI (for CSS).*

## Installation

1. Run Brackets
2. Select *File > Install Extension...*
3. Enter `https://github.com/Fornace/minify-more/archive/master.zip` as Extension URL.
3. Click Install to begin downloading and installing the extension.

#### Alternative method
Clone this repository into `~/Library/Application Support/Brackets/extensions/user/` and restart Brackets.

## Usage
To minify a file, use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl+M`. You can also minify files on save by checking the corresponding item in the *Edit* menu.

## Version

`Version 0.2.0`
